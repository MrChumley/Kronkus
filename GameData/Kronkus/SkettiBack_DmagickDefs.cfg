@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[magScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = Nothing to analyze in magnetic diapason - swirling and boiling gases of Kronkus atmosphere probably moved huge electricity and created ideal magnetic storms. Fascinating oscillogram!
		SkettiInSpaceLow = You begin to suspect that this ball of ... spaghetti does not have a magnetic field at all. You drove away the thought of spaghetti.
		SkettiSrfLandedAboveIt = Nope, magnetosphere are very thin and weak, and ends high in atmosphere.
		SkettiSrfLandedDownInIt = Yes, faint magnetic field with strange inclination is really exist! You start think about serious noodle business.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmRadiometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = No interference in ionic field around Kronkus detected.
		SkettiInSpaceLow = Minor changes in the solar wind were recorded at the sensitivity boundary.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[scopeScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = This strange planet does have atmosphere and some surface formations.
		SkettiInSpaceLow = You pretty sure that surface is very similar to something familiar and edible...
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmImagingPlatform]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = Strange weak readings. Maybe we need to fly closer.
		SkettiInSpaceLow = Weak heat dispasson recorded; some clay with unknown composition covers all surface.
		SkettiInSpaceLowAboveIt = Colder layers of this clay were detected. Chemical composition is too comples to analyse.
		SkettiInSpaceLowDownInIt = Sensor scans detect some spaghetti down here. You start  to doubt in sensor data.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmNAlbedoScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiSrfLanded = Some hydrogen compound is filled these areas.
		SkettiSrfLandedAboveIt = On, c'mon! Spaghetti contains water?
		SkettiSrfLandedDownInIt = No way appropriate name for this crazy place. It's contain ethane hydrocarbon!
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmXRayDiffract]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiSrfLanded = The sensor probe stuck in this mass. After re-sampling, it turned out that this is a silicate dough.
		SkettiSrfLandedAboveIt = Silicate, liquid and solid silicate. Mostly solid.
		SkettiSrfLandedDownInIt = Liquid and solid silicate again, but here are mostly liquid.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmlaserblastscan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiSrfLanded = Laser roast this clay onto grey-brown crust with strange chemical compound.
		SkettiSrfLandedAboveIt = Fired sample more dense, less liquid evaporated.
		SkettiSrfLandedDownInIt = More liquid in sample are slowing firing.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmSolarParticles]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = Detected elements from Kronkus atmosphere: sample are composed of Ammonia, Methane and Hydrogen sulfide and enriched by water ice.
		SkettiInSpaceLow = The samples here come mostly from the rings of Kronkus, and contains some ices and silicates.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmSoilMoisture]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceLow = Low levels of microwave emissions are recorded from Sketti's surface, maybe its surface contain little water.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmRadiometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = Strong UV and shortwave IR absorption by Sketti atmosphere suggests the presence of high levels of Carbon Dioxide and possibly Methane.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmbiodrillscan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiSrfLanded = Mysterious dough-like something produced a strange stale gas in the incubator.
		SkettiSrfLandedAboveIt = The dough sample dried and stuck in the test tube
		SkettiSrfLandedDownInIt = Interior of incubator is covered with droplets of evaporated liquid. There are no signs of life.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmSIGINT]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceLow = The white noise with indescribable rhythmic wobbles from Kronkus are recorded. You start to dance.
		SkettiInSpaceLowAboveIt = Sketti atmosphere produces some interesting radio wave emissions.
		SkettiInSpaceLowDownInIt = There are blasted sounds in radio!
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmSIGINT]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = This picture looks like something strange and edible.
		SkettiInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = No, you kidding?! How this moon exist?
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[dmseismicHammer]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		SkettiSrfLanded = Seismic hammer sticked to this... glue. A strange planet!
		SkettiSrfLandedAboveIt = No waves recorded, probably rubber-like surface absorbs it?
		SkettiSrfLandedDownInIt = Weak waves were written, whatnot?
