	@RESULTS

		KronkusInSpaceHigh = The magnetic field of Kronkus extends all the way past Kersex's orbit, completely encompassing the space around this purple gas giant.
		KronkusInSpaceLow = The magnetic field here is confusing... Some storms generate massive electronic flux, while other only produce smaller magnetic anomalies.
		KersexInSpaceHigh = A moderate, but complete magnetic field is detected; however as Kersex moves into Kronkus's magnetic field, a large radiation flux is detected.
		KersexInSpaceLow = The magnetic field seems variable, but some areas have complete magnetic loops protecting them from Kronkus' radiation belts.
		KersexLandedPeaks = Kersex magnetic data was interrupted with spike from Kronkus magnetosphere; this place apparently not suitable for storing data in floppy disks or mag-tape.
		KersexSrfLandedHeights = The magnetosphere readings from the Kersex highlands seems to be highly variable due to interactions between other celestial bodies. Of course, we're landed on moon of gas giant!
		KersexSrfLandedLowlands = The magnetic field here is strong enough to isolate the Kronkian radiation. This is an excellent place to start a colony!
		KersexSrfLandedDesert = The magnetic field is surprisingly stable and strong. Maybe we can build sand-kayaks and ride here with a compass?
		KersexSrfLandedArctica = The magnetic field shakes and spazzes in all directions!
		KersexSrfLandedHenge = You are interested by strange magnetic field phenomena; you suppose, that metallic anomaly right there?
		KersexSrfLandedPoles = Multiple changes in magnetic waves and flashing of polar auroras stop you from pinpointing magnetic poles. Possibly, we are here.... or here?
		KersexSrfSplashedWater = The magnetometer abruptly jerks, but even such distorted information is enough to fix a stable magnetic dipole.
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = Nothing to analyze in magnetic diapason - swirling and boiling gases of Kronkus atmosphere theoretically produce huge electric fields and create ideal magnetic storms. Fascinating oscillogram!
		SkettiInSpaceLow = You begin to suspect that this ball of ... spaghetti does not have a magnetic field at all. You drive away the thought of spaghetti.
		SkettiSrfLandedAboveIt = Nope, magnetosphere here is very thin and weak, and ends high in the atmosphere.
		SkettiSrfLandedDownInIt = Yes, faint magnetic field with strange inclination really does exist! You start to think about serious noodle business.
		MeeloInSpaceHigh = You deployed the magnetometer without any suspicion - and suddenly detected Kronkus magnetic field deformation. Possibly indicating that Meelo has a metallic core?
		MeeloInSpaceLow = In comparison with the Mun, the magnetic disturbances are caused not only by the solidified metal.  Is it possible that gravitational interactions with Kersex deform and heat the metal core?
		MeeloSrfLandedPeaks = Excellent chaos in magnetic diapason! Magnetic fields of Kronkus, Kersex and Meelo seem to be interfering and mixing together.
		MeeloSrfLandedMidlands = Metallic composites under the surface have influenced the readings of the magnetic fields on the surface of Meelo's Midlands. Readings are confusing, you hypothesize that semi-fluid magma partially distorts readings of Kronkus' magnetic field.
		MeeloSrfLandedLowlands = Magnetic readings of this area are quite random and disoriented. No global magnetic field is detected in the Lowlands of Meelo.
		MeeloSrfLandedMissedlands = This place has a strong magnetic field... vertically oriented.
		EahpehInSpaceHigh = Only ambient Kronkus magnetic field with disturbance by Kersex detected.
		EahpehInSpaceLow = This monotone snowball does not emit any magnetic field.
		EahpehSrfLandedSeepingBlue = No magnetic readings, only ambient Kronkus fields detected here.
		EahpehSrfLandedIcesheet = According to your magnetometer, you are flying in Kronkus' magnetic field.  It finally locates itself on Eahpeh, but the readings have not changed.
		ScoolInSpaceHigh = The magnetometer does not record any changes in Kronkus' magnetic field at all. Perhaps this little dirty moon does not generate a magnetic field?
		ScoolInSpaceLow = Suspicions have been confirmed, Scool has no detectable magnetic field.
		ScoolSrfLanded = Ice sheets here do not contain magnetic materials.
		ScoolSrfLandedHighlands = There are no magnetic fields detected on Scool's highlands.
		ScoolSrfLandedMidlands = Some disturbances are picked up by your magnetic scans... They seem to be originating from... Kersex.
		ScoolSrfLandedIcebowls = Slow show of swivel snow. No readings at all from this magnetic bowl.

		KronkusInSpaceHigh = High concentrations of ionized plasma are detected on the border of Kronkus' magnetosphere.
		KronkusInSpaceLow = Powerful electrical discharges in dense clouds overload one of antenna, you fear the loss of the entire sensor.
		KersexInSpaceHigh = Radiometer scans indicate the electrons and protons are migrating in many different directions around Kronkus and Kersex.
		KersexInSpaceLow = Solar ions are less powerful here. Maybe magnetic anomalies on the surface slow down these particles?
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = No interference in ionic fields around Sketti are detected.
		SkettiInSpaceLow = Minor changes in the solar wind were recorded at the sensitivity boundary.
		MeeloInSpaceHigh = Radiometric data indicates that solar wind reacts mostly with Kronkus, but not with Meelo.
		MeeloInSpaceLow = Some influence of small magnetic fields on Meelo were recorded, but no global magnetosphere on Meelo was detected.
		EahpehInSpaceHigh = Only solar wind deformation with magnetic fields influenced by Kronkus and Kersex are detected; Eahpeh has no influence on such things, charged particles just bombard his icy surface.
		EahpehInSpaceLow = Eahpeh alternately passes the less dense Kronkus magnetosphere, and a more powerful interaction between Kronkus and Kersex. Eahpeh is just along for the ride.
		ScoolInSpaceHigh = Solar particles fly freely in the weak peripheral of Kronkus' magnetic field.
		ScoolInSpaceLow = Radiometric scans indicate that Scool does not deform the solar wind in any detectable way.  This will be important to multiple, upcoming, kerbal-level college students writing up their theses.

		KronkusInSpaceLow = You take a series of detailed pictures of several upper layers of spiraling clouds. Mostly ice formation interactions in gases detected.
		KronkusInSpaceHigh = Purple cloud structures assure you, that Kronkus is gas giant. For more details you need to be closer.
		KersexInSpaceHigh = You think that is Kerbin - but after you recheck the flight plan, and witness the rise of the Kronkus you are sure, that is another planet, Kersex.
		KersexInSpaceLow = Closer observation from this position shows differences in forms of continents and colors of surface. In addition, KSC buildings are absent.
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = This strange planet does have atmosphere and some surface formations.
		SkettiInSpaceLow = You are pretty sure that the surface is very similar to something familiar and edible...
		MeeloInSpaceHigh = Craters, gray graphite, and coal colors are noted on the surface. Hills and canyons without craters - maybe Meelo's surface is younger than the others? 
		MeeloInSpaceLow = Detected traces of some thermal processes and semi-fluid pseudo-volcanoes.  This might explain the lack of craters.
		EahpehInSpaceHigh = Tiny lump of salted ice - that's it.
		EahpehInSpaceLow = Ice under thermal, tidal, and possibly nuclear forces cause melting in some places on the vast ice-sheets on Eahpeh.  Smoothing some areas, while buckling others.
		ScoolInSpaceHigh = Some interesting small features are noted on this outer icy moon! We should fly closer and observe it's dusty surface!
		ScoolInSpaceLow = Awesome surface! No craters. Maybe Scool is sticky?

	@RESULTS
	{
		KronkusInSpaceHigh = IR-sensors detect much more heat than Kronkus absorbs by the Sun. This planet's high cloud layers consist of water, ammonia, and nitrogen, as well as rocky dust. This confirms the classification of Kronkus as an icy giant.
		KronkusInSpaceLow = Mid-layers of icy clouds contain more silicates and carbon than expected. You surprisingly detect ethane gas and small amounts of mercury!
		KersexInSpaceHigh = UV and IR scan results are similar to Kerbin, but high layers in Kersex atmosphere are higher and denser. Basic materials are similar, nitrogen, oxygen and water. Water appears more abundant here than on Kerbin!
		KersexInSpaceLow = Truth! Water in the highest layers of Kersex atmosphere really is more abundant than on Kerbin! The higher altitude of the atmosphere results in less intense solar wind. Local concentrations of argon and xenon confirmed, as well as a curiously high trace of elemental helium.
		KersexInSpaceLowPeaks = IR sensors detect increasing temperature; UV-band scanners detect high levels of Sulfur - possibly indicative of volcanoes down there.
		KersexInSpaceLowHeights = Higher levels of infrared rays are detected here possibly from geologic activity. Apparently, tidal forces of Kronkus, Meelo, and Eahpeh are sustaining heat in the core of Kronkus. Magnesite and silicate spectres are detected by UV-sensor.
		KersexInSpaceLowLowlands = Based on infrared scans, you think about warm and humid climates in this biome. Only small UV doses reflecting from surface, indicating silicates, carbon, and water.
		KersexInSpaceLowDesert = Scanners confirm that you probably do not to want land here.  Hot - with high levels of UV-radiation - Chemical reactions of hot and cold gases generate dangerous organic compounds. Refraction scans seem to indicate the presence quartzite and silicates.
		KersexInSpaceLowArctica = Very fuzzy thermal data, very cold surface; many reflections of weak UV-rays, mostly water.
		KersexInSpaceLowHenge = A very strange, pulsed image, containing high levels in the UV and IR bands has been recorded. This place apparently has strong geological activity with volcanoes and GEYSERS. Also, an exciting number of heavy minerals, some never before detected in their natural state!  This is amazing!
		KersexInSpaceLowPoles = Many ultraviolet ray emissions are detected here.  Solar plasma reacts with magnetic fields surrounding Kronkus, and are in turn, reacted on by magnetic fields on Kersex.  The resulting polar auroras and high-energy power emissions are breathtaking. Only water is detected by UV-refraction; no infrared is detected from the surface at all.  This is odd, but you take a deep breath and record your observations.
		KersexInSpaceLowWater = The atmosphere here is saturated with water molecules. Humidity and temperature are very high, there appear to be indications of several underwater hot-spots as well.
		SkettiInSpaceHigh = Strange weak readings. Maybe we need to fly closer.
		SkettiInSpaceLow = Weak heat dissipation recorded; some clay with unknown composition inclusions cover the surface.
		SkettiInSpaceLowAboveIt = Colder layers of this clay were detected. Chemical composition is too complex to analyze.
		SkettiInSpaceLowDownInIt = Sensor scans detect some spaghetti down here. You start to have doubts about sensor manufacturers.
		MeeloInSpaceHigh = Initial scans of Meelo reveal a complex chemical powder makeup on the surface. You think about commissioning a brush and sponge for it.
		MeeloInSpaceLow = Infrared spectrography analysis is rewarding with particularly higher temperatures in some places than expected.  The surface contains mostly carbon and silicates.  Although, in some craters the UV-sensor indicates water ice.
		MeeloSrfLandedPeaks = Some thermal emissions are detected here, indicating some kind of tectonic hot-spot.
		MeeloInSpaceLowMidlands = These relatively high-elevation plateaus are mostly featureless in IR scans, showing characteristics of common silicates and other basaltic minerals.
		MeeloInSpaceLowLowlands = Strong IR reflection bands indicated that the surface here has mostly accumulated over eons, and is classified as some sort of regolith.
		MeeloInSpaceLowMissedlands = This strange area is covered in basaltic rock with spectra indicative of aluminium.

		EahpehInSpaceHigh = This icy green ball does not emit heat it only reflects it. Water with traces of sodium chloride and other components are detected in UV-dissipation.
		EahpehInSpaceLow = Water with sodium chloride, and possibly carbon dioxide contained in the smooth green icy crust. Looks unsweetened anyway.
		EahpehInSpaceLowSeepingBlue = Because temperature of this body is very low, IR-scanners are useless. Otherwise, UV-band surprises you with finding traces of oxygen and ozone.
		EahpehInSpaceLowIcesheet = There is more carbon dioxide than in other places. You start to yawn from the boring surface...

		ScoolInSpaceHigh = Yay, another dirty space snowball!
		ScoolInSpaceLow = These dirty spots contain traces of some polymers.
		ScoolInSpaceLowHighlands = Thermal images from these mountains show a cold surface, without traces of any geological processes.
		ScoolInSpaceLowMidlands = Frozen gases, again. Nothing unsuspected.
		ScoolInSpaceLowIcebowls = More frozen compounds of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur! Oxygen and silicates are lower than 1 percent.
